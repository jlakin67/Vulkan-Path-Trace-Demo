# Vulkan-Path-Trace-Demo
This is a rough outline for myself for writing path tracers in Vulkan. The images below show my first implementation of path traced diffuse global illumination using the VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline extension. There are still some artifacts that I am trying to smooth out. I wrote this based off code from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ so the code is full of verbose Vulkan
